# StudySpace

## Purpose 
StudySpace is a tool designed to help students with their study sessions and help boost their productivity and overall organization. By creating a program with a task list, stopwatch, and even background music, students can find all their studying needs in one place. 

## Features

### Starting Screen
When you open the program, the first thing you'll see is our starting screen with a randomized motivational quote to encourage users and set the right tone. To get started, simply click on the "Main Screen" button. 

### Task List 
Enter in all the things you hope to accomplish in a session and check them off as you go. The progress bar at the top will let you know how much you've accomplished so far while you're studying.

### Stopwatch and Study Breaks 
Make sure to start the stopwatch at the top to keep track of how long you've been studying. At the set intervals (see more under customization) a message will pop-up to remind you to take a break from studying. A healthy body is essential for academic success, so every time you see a study break pause the stopwatch to grab a snack or go for a walk, and resume the stopwatch whenever you make it back.

### Screenshots
Whether you want to save your progress to continue from where you left off tomorrow, or you want to capture your productivity and share it with your friends, you can keep track of your session by taking a screenshot. A picture of your screen will automatically be taken and put into a folder named "progress". 

## Customization 

### Theme Colours
In the pop-out window you will see a section in which you can choose from a variety of different theme options. Choosing any colour from the window will immediately change the display for the whole program. 

### Music 
Our audio options (classical, lo-fi, and brown noise) are chosen specifically to be an aid to your studying and give those who require some audio stimulation to study a chance for success. You can choose which track to listen to from the pop-out window and pause/resume as you desire. 

## Study Break Intervals 
You can decided which intervals you'd like to recieve study breaks so that you can tailor your experience with this program to be best suited for your schedule.
